    <h2>Part 1: Set up and Hijacking</h2>
    <br />
    <div>
        <p>Described as being in his mid-40s and wearing a dark suit, a tie, and a raincoat, a man purchased a ticket under the name Dan Cooper and boarded Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305, a Boeing 727. <br />
        The ticket was for a single flight from Portland, Oregon to Seattle, Washington. The people on the plane included 36 passengers and 6 crew members. Cooper sat in the last row of the plane in the <br />
        middle seat on the right side of the cabin. As the plane departed, he ordered a drink, smoked a cigarette, then handed an envelope with a note to the flight attendant, which read: <br />
        <b>"I have a bomb here and I would like you to sit by me."</b> <br /> 
        When the flight attendant sat next to Cooper, he opened his briefcase to show the attendant 8 sticks of dynamite hidden inside it. </p>
